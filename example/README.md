#Scala-Pact Example Projects

##Consumer

##Provider

##Pact Broker
This is example project does not include pact broker.
We use a simple script to send the pact file from the consumer to the provider.
Please see the main readme file on how to use pact broker.

##TODO
- Provider states
- pact test
- Setup basic service
- Script to deliver the pact file for verification
- Scripts that encapsulate the commands?
