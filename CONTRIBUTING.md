# How to contribute

All efforts to contribute to this project are welcome and encouraged. Scala-Pact can only be better with more eyes looking for problems and more minds trying to solve them.

If you would like to contribute, there are principally two ways you can help.

### Raising issues
If we don't know there is a problem, we can't help fix it.

Please feel free to raise issues if you can't get something to work, find a bug, or you have any ideas for improvements.

Try and be as specific as possible, ideally you should include steps to re-produce your issue if it's a bug, or some sort of rationale for new features.

### Code
We will always try to accept code submissions. If you'd like to discuss a change before you make it, please raise an issue and describe the work you're planning to do.

If you would like to improve the project by contributing code, please fork the repo, make your change and submit a pull request.
